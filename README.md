# I2TheTerascale
Here you will find the [code](https://github.com/theofil/I2TheTerascale/tree/main/code) & [documentation](https://github.com/theofil/I2TheTerascale/raw/main/docs/main.pdf) from the [Introduction to the Terascale](https://indico.desy.de/event/33888/) tutorial given at DESY. 

## Before the tutorial 
The bulk of the exercises will be based on ROOT and C++. Having it installed in your local computer has the advantage of keeping the software ready to be used for other purposes, after the schools ends.

It is **highly recommended** to:
* Install [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch "ROOT") in your laptop, over Linux/Unix OS if possible.
* Read as much as you can from the most recent version of the [documentation](https://github.com/theofil/I2TheTerascale/raw/main/docs/main.pdf).

If your laptop is Windows-only, you might find useful also to look the  [ROOT_Windows_InstallationFromSource.pdf](https://github.com/theofil/I2TheTerascale/blob/main/docs/ROOT_Windows_InstallationFromSource.pdf) in case you have hard time following the official instructions of [https://root.cern/install/](https://root.cern/install/).

Should  time allows, we might see also examples of how to do similar things using columnar-style of analysis with python and jupiter notebooks, without using ROOT/C++.
